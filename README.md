# Detection and Classification of Traffic Anomalies on Urban Arterial
## Final Year Project 2019  Keidi Kapllani
### Abstract
This final year project focuses on anomaly detection on urban arterial roads using
microscopic traffic variables. It is mainly concerned with the detection and classification
of speed anomalies in vehicles as well as clustering of these oscillations. The
proposed algorithms and methods and applied and evaluated on NGSIM trajectory
data taken on the US-101 highway. First, with the aim of pre-processing the data
for noise removal, sEMA filtering and Discrete Wavelet Transform denoising are
applied. The speed anomalies are then detected using an algorithm which has as
its core the Continuous Wavelet Transform. Following that, a multitude of clustering
algorithms is presented and evaluated for our specific problem. Finally, a novel
statistical method is used to detect breakpoints in the oscillations.
